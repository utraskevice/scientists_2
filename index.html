                        Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and
                        one of the
                        most influential men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687,
                        is considered
                        to be the most influential book in the history of science. <br><br>

                    Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy
                    equivalence,
                    expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to
                    Theoretical
                    Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. <br><br>

                    Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most important scientist and
                    inventor of the
                    modern age, a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many revolutionary
                    contributions in the
                    field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <br><br>
